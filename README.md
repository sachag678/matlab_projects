# matlab_projects
These are quick small projects that I use to further my understanding of algorithms.

The .m file generally contain the algorithm applied to simple cases. 

For example the em.m algorithm is applied to a discrete two coin, coin toss problem where we are unaware of which coin was used to toss
but are aware of the result. 

The em_gaussian.m contains code that calculates the means and variances of a 1-D 2 moment gaussian distribution.
